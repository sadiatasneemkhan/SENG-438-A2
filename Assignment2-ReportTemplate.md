# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

Since the lab required 10 methods to be tested, each team member was responsible for writing unit tests for 2-3 methods. After all the test cases had been completed, all the members gathered for a meeting and discussed each test case individually to see if they included all the requirements. This also allowed us to also learn from each other about unit testing, as we shared the thought process we conducted while designing our own test cases. For the lab report, all the members read through each required section and noted down short, brief notes that would be expanded on later in the report. Then we split the report sections so each member had a fair share of work. Before submitting, the group gathered again to review the report and be certain that all the lab requirements had been met.

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

During this second lab, the majority of our group's problems came not from the content but other sources. No one in our group had much experience with Eclipse, so we had to work as a group to navigate our way through this unfamiliar IDE. Also we had a few difficulties handling the sheer volume of files involved while setting up the assignment. Both these challenges were overcome by communicating as a group and not being afraid to ask for help if stuck at any point.
